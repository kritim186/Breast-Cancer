# Breast-Cancer
 The breast cancer dataset is a widely used dataset for binary classification tasks in machine learning and is particularly used to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.
